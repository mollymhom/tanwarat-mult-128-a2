            <h2>Reflection on Using JavaScript and CSS Libraries</h2>
            <p>Integrating JavaScript and CSS libraries like jQuery, anime.js, and Animate.css into this project has been both rewarding and challenging. These tools significantly improved the website's look and interactive features, enabling complex user interactions that would have otherwise been hard and slow to code from scratch.</p>
        
            <p>jQuery made it much easier to handle changes on the webpage, allowing quick and efficient updates in response to user inputs. This drastically cut down the amount of code needed. Anime.js added a fun and simple way to create animations, giving the site a smooth and professional feel. Animate.css also enhanced the site's visual appeal with little effort by providing ready-to-use animations that I could apply just by adding some classes.</p>
        
            <p>However, these benefits came with challenges. Getting good at using anime.js required a lot of learning, including reading through its documentation to understand all its features. Making sure the libraries worked well together and across different browsers introduced additional complexity. Relying on these external libraries also affected the websiteâ€™s loading speed and overall performance, which needed adjustments to keep everything running smoothly.</p>
        
            <p>Looking back, the positives outweighed the negatives. Being able to boost user engagement and the visual quality of the website was extremely valuable. This project emphasized the importance of choosing the right libraries and greatly enhanced my skills in integrating and using these tools effectively in web development. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also my decision-making in selecting tools for specific needs.</p>
